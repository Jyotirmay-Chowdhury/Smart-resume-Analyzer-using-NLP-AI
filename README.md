Smart resume Analyzer using NLP (AI)

# INTRODUCTION

This Python web application analyzes resumes using Streamlit. 


In addition to processing user input and doing other tasks including scoring, recommendation-making, and resume processing, it also creates a connection to a MySQL database.


The code can provide download links, show PDFs, and suggest courses, among other things. 


The first step of the program is to import the required Python packages, which include pandas for data manipulation, Streamlit for constructing the web interface, and additional applications for geocoding and PDF processing. 


Two preprocessing procedures are defined to read text from PDFs and generate CSV download links. 


Tools to recommend courses based on a list are offered, and PDF content can be shown using Streamlit markdown capabilities. 


These seem to be parts of a bigger program that prioritizes user engagement and information display. 


The code additionally establishes a connection to a MySQL database and adds functions for appending
comments and user data to certain tables. 


The page settings, namely the title and favicon, are configured using Streamlit. 


The run() function is the main component of the application. 

It loads the app's logo, sets up a sidebar with the user options, and controls the admin features, page display, user input, and feedback. 


The admin section allows for data analysis, including charts and tables related to user submissions and feedback. 


Apart from obtaining contact information such as name and email, the user-side code uploads a resume for review. 


It evaluates the resume, makes talent recommendations, and determines the user's degree of experience.


A form is used to collect feedback, and suggestions for improving the user's CV are emailed to them. 


With the right credentials, one can access the admin section, which offers insights into user statistics such as counts, feedback distribution, and regional data. 


To summarise, the code creates a Streamlit web application that analyses resumes and facilitates user interaction while storing information in a MySQL database. 


Apart from resume processing and user comments, it also has an admin section with data analysis options. 


The structure and features provide job seekers with a comprehensive tool to enhance their resumes and obtain valuable insights.
